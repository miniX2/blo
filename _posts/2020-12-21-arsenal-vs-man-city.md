## My Prediction on the lineup for our match with Arsenal

## Defence:

### Steffen - Ederson has been peforming good and barely conceding any goals at the moment. However, he needs a bit of a rest after playing this amount of games in a row. During this period of the season, games can become congested and it proved to nearly cost us in 18-19 as well as costing us in 19-20. Also, Steffen hasn't been tested properly yet and can't be judged yet. Arsenal have seemingly took cup competitions seriously to an extent and that has been the highlight of their season so far, so they will surely test Steffen a lot.

### Cancelo - Walker needs a rest and Cancelo needs to play in his actual position. If Cancelo can play in his proper position, he can actually play good in this game. As we saw against West Brom towards the end, inverted fullbacks seemingly don't work for us at the moment. As Pep wants more chance creation to score goals, Cancelo should get the nod as he is more offensively potent than Walker.

### Ake - While momentum is key, we need to use our other centre back options against Arsenal. Ake should be good enough for Pep to pick him against the Gunners. He hasn't played in a couple games so he should be match sharp and fit to handle the Arsenal Forwards. Also, this is a chance for Ake to assert himself into the manager's plans for what his starting team should be.

### Laporte - Same reason as Ake. He hasn't played often recently due to the successful partnership of Dias and Stones at the base of our defence. Also, he hasn't played since West Brom so this is another chance for him to get back into Pep's Plans for future matches this season as well as our starting team in key and significant games during the course of this season.

### Mendy - Cancelo at LB can cause us some problems, we lack a direct and proper outlet on that left flank. While he is good going forward, he has to cut inside since he is not a proper LB. Whereas, Benjamin Mendy can go outwide while our wingers can go inside since he is an actual attacking LB. Mendy's qualities going forward has been shown in glimpses from time to time since he joined in 2017 - especially his form before his first injury of many that he would get at the club.

## Midfield:

### Gundogan - He has been one of our best peforming players in recent times; A good peformance against West Brom and Southampton recently as well as him scoring in the former fixture. Gundogan is probably the best player that we can use in that position as of now since Fernandinho is beginning to age right now and Rodri has been slightly inconsistent this season.

### Bernardo - Bernardo Silva peformed pretty well recently against Southampton despite not registering a goal or an assist in that game. His intensity and energy will be key in this match against Arsenal, as well as his playmaking ability that he has shown during his time at Monaco as well as some matches at Man City. Also, he can drive our team forward much like Foden and De Bruyne which creates more space and openings to score goals.

### Foden - He hasn't played too often recently and he is the attacking flair that we need in this game against Arsenal. KDB need some rest for this match after playing 3 matches in a row against Manchester United, West Brom and Southampton. This should be the chance for Foden to get more gametime that he has deserved but not received from Guardiola this season.

## Attack:

### Mahrez - Sterling needs some rest after playing multiple games in a row and this game seems to be built for Riyad Mahrez to operate with his cutting inside ability and drawing players to him. With Cancelo making runs to the right side of the pitch, Mahrez could potentially be a weapon in this game and score some goals to take us through this game and into the Carabao Cup Semis

### Aguero - We need a finisher in this match and who is better at the club in finishing than Aguero. While he is recovering from an injury, he recently received - he allows Jesus to have a slight rest and his form against Arsenal is pretty good. 11 Goals and 2 Assists in 18 games against Arsenal; He could potentially kickoff his season properly against Arsenal and his ability would back that.

### Ferran - We don't need to utilise Sterling in this fixture since we now have Ferran as a player that go to the left wing. He has shown that he can score and create chances in his brief games for Manchester City and his time at Valencia before the firesale that occurred there. This could potentially be a match that cements his position and potentially starting for us if he delivers massively.

## Predictions:

### Score - 3:0 win
### Goals - Aguero (brace), Foden
### Assists - Ferran, Bernardo, Mahrez
### MOTM - Aguero
